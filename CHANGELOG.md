## 0.1.0 (build 1)

- Add a native macOS InputMethodKit / AppKit input method with a Free Pascal helper, local ONNX inference and simplified/traditional dictionaries.

- Support full pinyin, abbreviated pinyin, six double-pinyin schemes, fuzzy matching, local learning and Tab completion.
- Keep the candidate panel at two rows, show up to nine candidates, highlight the selected item and allow removal of user words.
- Provide eight appearance options, font completion, live previews, native shortcut recording and automatically saved settings.
- Show an animated Chinese/English status bubble with the color logo and 13-point text at the caret on mode changes and input-source activation; avoid system cursor accessories, dismiss automatically and respect reduced motion.
- Use the color logo in the input menu and link About and Settings to the macOS website.
- Handle Chinese punctuation, cold-start keystrokes, focus changes, secure fields and recovery from helper failures.
